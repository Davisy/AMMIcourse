# Lecture on self supervised representation learning for pre-training speech systems (1h20)

By Laurent Besacier, Naver Labs Europe and Univ. Grenoble Alpes


Such approaches are very important to reduce dependence on labeled data for building speech systems. This is particularly relevant for languages with poorly standardized orthography or even for unwritten languages.
